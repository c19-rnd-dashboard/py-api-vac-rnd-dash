38,20,No,NasoVax Analog (Not Currently Specified),,AdCOVID (based on NasoVax),Altimmune,Vaccine - Prophylactic,COVID-19,Gene therapies,Vaccine,Repurposed-Not Approved,University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB),United States,Ongoing,This is a repurposing of the NasoVax technology (recombinant intranasal) for a COVID-19 vaccine; It should be noted that the provided source on Atimmune's Nasovax-based COVID-19 vaccine was published on February 28. Since then there has been no news on the vaccine until March 30 which is when a new article was published stating that Altimmune will collaborate with UAB to develop AdCOVID. Because AdCOVID possesses the same characteristics as the NasoVax analog (recombinant vaccine - single-dose - and intranasal) I believe that this entry should be reclassified as AdCOVID. NasoVax is still currently in a Phase 2a trial so I have opted to classify AdCOVID as a repurposed-not approved product.

The recent study on using washed microbiota transplantation (WMT) as rescue therapy in critically ill patients with AAD demonstrated the important clinical benefits and safety of WMT. Additionally the recent animal study provided direct evidence supporting that antibiotics could decrease gut microbiota and the lung stromal interferon signature and facilitate early influenza virus replication in lung epithelia. Importantly the above antibiotics caused negative effects can be reversed by fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) which suggested that FMT might be able to induce a significant improvement in the respiratory virus infection.,,Discovery,,2/5/2020,,,,,,,,,,,Experimental,Condition,40,No,1,Medical Center for Digestive Diseases - The Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University - Jiangsu - China,02/05/2020,04/30/2020,04/30/2020,NCT04251767,Invitation only,,Natalie Tang,4/9/2020,,,,,,4/9/2020
